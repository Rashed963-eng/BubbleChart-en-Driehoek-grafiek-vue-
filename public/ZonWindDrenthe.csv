Groene energie klinkt lekker maar er wordt ook CO2 uitgestoten tijdens fabricage van de zonnepanelen en windmolens, daar hoor je niemand over. 
Zonnevelden doen, vindt ik afbreuk aan het landschap. Als je een nieuwbouwhuis wil laten bouwen dan komt er een Welstandscommissie aan het woord die denken advies te moeten geven over iets dat in de omgeving zou passen terwijl zonnevelden mijn inziens het natuurlijke landschap ontsieren.

Het moeten geen landschapvervuilers worden. Het wordt nu teveel overgelaten aan cowboys, die in korte tijd een hoop geld willen verdienen. Wat dat betreft zou de lokale overheid een actievere rol moeten spelen. Hoge windmolens zijn vreselijke horizon vervuilers. Die horen niet in het Drentse landschap, ook niet in de veenkoloniën. Als ons land toch aan de zee ligt, plaats ze dan op de Noordzee en niet op land.

Daarmee onderscheiden wij ons van andere provincies en dat moet zo blijven. Het is daarom belangrijk dat nieuwe elementen in het landschap ( zonneparken) goed passen in de omgeving en ook iets toevoegen aan de biodiversiteit. Stel daarvoor heldere criteria. En die criteria mogen geen financiele sluitpost zijn. 
Voor windturbines ligt dit moeilijker. Deze machines gaan moeilijk op in het karakteristieke drentse landschap. Vandaar dat lokaties op grote oppervlaktes agrarisch industriegebied benut moeten worden. Er zal altijd weerstand zijn tegen plaatsing. Ook groene energie heeft zijn prijs. Door het te combineren met grote groenprojecten (boomaanplant in de vorm van singels en wallen voor meer biodiversiteit) en door bewoners te betrekken bij de plannen, kan er meer draagvlak ontstaan.

Je leest erover en je verwacht dat het allemaal wel even duurt.  De verandering is echter onnavolgbaar snel. Voorheen wist ik niet zo goed wat horizonvervuiling was maar daar heb ik nu een beeld bij.  Van dichtbij zijn de windmolens machtige machines en ergens ook wel sierlijk. Van veraf zijn ze alom aanwezig en trekken ze de aandacht. Ik was nog niet klaar om ze die aandacht te geven.  Ik vind ze niet sympathiek en heb ook niet het gevoel dat ze er ook voor mij staan.  Ze zullen ook nooit mijn sympathie krijgen evenals de zonneparken die ook veel plaats innemen behalve in mijn hart. 
Maar het maakt me ook bewust. De vele aardgaslocaties en de scheuren in mijn huis hebben daarvoor gezorgd. En dan ruil ik graag wat scheuren in voor wat *horizonvervuiling'.  En als ik dan het grotere plaatje bekijk dan valt er nog veel meer te verliezen dan alleen wat horizonvervuiling.

Er wordt ook niet ingegaan op de onzin van ""van het gas afgaan"". Met de geweldige infrastructuur en gas als schonere, efficiënte warmtebron is er geen schoner alternatief voor onze slecht geisoleerde huizen.

Ik ben Passief Huis consultant en ook met de huidige BENG normen, verkwisten we nog massa's energie omdat de zomers opgewekte electriciteit  verrekend kan worden met gas in de winter: wat een onzin.
De warmtepomp is een grote energieslurper als 't kouder wordten we hebben de zware electrische infrastructuur niet in de straten liggen om al die warmtepompen strakt te kunnen laten draaien - bovendien moet 't op dat moment maar net zonnig of winderig zijn.
Beter te investeren in 
1) deugdelijke isolatie en alle nieuwbouw (ook kantoren etc) volgens passief-normen (passief-bouwen.nl) en
2) (groene) waterstof: windturbines op zee (waar ze 't meest effcient zijn) en (eventueel) gebruik van oude olieplatformen voor de fabricage van waterstof - ook daar ligt de infrastructuur als grootendeels op ons te wachten.

Hoe moeilijk kan 't zijn?

Jammer dat technisch inzicht en gezond verstand zo overduidelijk ontbreekt bij onze overheid (van de 150 kamerleden hebben er 149 een alpha-studie gevolgd!!) - de lagere overheden zien er vast niet veel anders uit, gezien de dingen die gedaan/voorgesteld worden!","0","Ja","0","56 – 65 jaar","Platteland"

De windmolens bv Duitsland-Coevorden al zichtbaar vanaf Hardenberg(stad) en Oosterhesselen.  Vervuiling van de horizon.  Het past dan beter langs een kale niet bewoonde kustlijn of polder.  Een zonnepark zoals langs de N34 tussen Coevorden en Steenwijksmoer is dan denk ik een minst storende factor.

Wij moeten ons focussen op CO2 neutraal of beter: energie opwekken zonder CO2 uitstoot. In de concept RES van Drenthe staat niet vermeld naar welke CO2 uitstoot  wordt gestreefd in 2050. In de RES worden begrippen als energieneutraal en zelfvoorzienend door elkaar gehaald, zie bijvoorbeel blad 61 luchthaven is zelfvoorzienend. In de RES vind ik geen schatting van de toename van electrische energie veroorzaakt door electrisch rijden. Verder staat niets vermeld over mini WKK's. Is Drenthe van plan een waterstoffabriek te bouwen of alle opgewekte electriciteit direct naar de afnemers te leiden. Verder mis ik  visie ten aanzien van het gebruiken van het Gasunie pijpleiding net voor het transport van waterstof.

Het is belangrijk dat de opwekking van energie plaatsvindt in de nabijheid van de verbruikers van deze energie om de loadfactor van het eletriciteitsnet te optimaliseren.

(wat helemaal vergeten is om de Drentsche wethouders zelf te informeren, zodat zij in ieder geval de begrippen kennen, zoals energie, vermogen, Joule, Watt, welke producten ontstaan bij verbranding van aardgas, benzine, kolen. Wat is Wp, wat is het rendement van zonnecellen,  wat is de productiefactor van windmolens etc.)

Voordat met de bewoners wordt gesproken eerst een aantal plannen met voor en nadelen vastleggen en deze plannen toegankelijk maken/verspreiden. In het document met de plannen ook voorlichting geven. Zoals: de energie die bij verbranding van 1 m3 aardgas onstaat komt overeen met 10 kWh. Een windmolen van 1000 kW levert 3.000 kWh per jaarop wanneer op land geplaatst en op zee met hoge molens 5.500 kWh.  Een zonneweide van 1 ha levert jaarlijks ca. 500.000 kWh op.
Maar ook: energieopslag is noodzakelijk.
Daarna bijeenkomsten houden om een toelichting te geven op de plannen en te discussieren over de plannen om samen tot een keus te komen die door de meerderheid wordt ondersteund.

Ik vraag mij af de provincie Drenthe zich daarvoor wel leent. Dergelijke bouwwerken zijn veel te grootschallig voor onze provincie. Het offer dat de natuur hiervoor moet brengen is daarom veel te groot. Dit geldt overigens ook voor parken met zonnepanelen. Verder vraag ik mij af of het rendement van deze parken in verhouding is met het offer dat de natuur hiervoor moet brengen. Zijn er bijvoorbeeld zoveel zonuren en is er altijd voldoende wind. De provincie Drenthe is veel te klein voor dergelijke grootschalige projecten. Er ligt voornamelijk wishfull thinking aan dergelijke ideeën ten grondslag.

"40174","18-11-2020","Personal","collector","","745baf","yes","Ja","","1","Voorbeelden die ik ken in Drenthe: 
Energiepark Pottendijk, Zonnepark Oranjepoort en het plan om zonnepanelen langs de A37 te plaatsen in de midden- en zijbermen. Dit zou ik enorm zonde vinden, omdat deze snelweg juist het landschappelijke van Drenthe belichaamt: Ruimtelijk en groen.  Dit volgooien met zonnepanelen, of ze nou grijs of groen zijn, vind ik persoonlijk ontzettend lelijk en afbreuk doen aan de mooie brede middenberm en zijbermen, waar nu bijna het hele jaar van alles groeit en bloeit, van voorjaar tot najaar.  Het 'volgooien' van de A37 met zonnepanelen is mijn ogen landschapsvervuiling en zonde. Past niet in Drenthe, een provincie die juist het landschap zou moeten omarmen en promoten voor wat het is. Lekker aan de Randstedelijke snelwegen laten die panelen. 
Verder ken ik nog de weilanden langs de N34 bij Coevorden waar nu zonnepanelen liggen. Ook lelijk om naar te kijken. Kun je beter wegwerken in een weiland die weliswaar dicht bij industrie of bedrijventerrein ligt maar omzoomd is door struiken/bossen. 
Er zijn ook zonnepanelen op water, ben ik ook geen voorstander van, zeker niet grootschalig. Behalve de lelijke aanblik is er volgens mij geen gedegen onderzoek gedaan naar de lange termijn gevolgen voor natuur/water/ecosystemen. Kan dus best veel verstoren op gebied van planten, vissen, vogels, eigenlijk alles wat op en in het water leeft. Mijn voorkeur is dus zonne-energie op of bij industrieterreinen en bedrijvenparken, dan hebben we toch een duurzame energieopwekking maar zo min mogelijk landschapsvervuiling.","0","0.68","0.32","0","0","0.35","0.65","0","0","0.60869565217391","0.36220472440945","0","0","0.36","0.64","0","0","Energietransitie ja, landschapsvervuiling nee","0","0.61","0.39","0","0","0.41","0.59","0","0","Een combinatie van beiden","0","1","0","0","0","0.48396773226","0.51621975009197","0.85176562657944","0","0","0","2","1","4","3","6","7","8","5","0","0","0.67938271547743","0.4138094893116","0.66443782814601","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","","0","0","0.39","0.61","0","0","Via inloopavonden, informatieavonden, inspreekmogelijkheden tijdens die avonden, informatiebrochures, keuzemogelijkheden voorleggen, écht luisteren en ingaan op zorgen van mensen, via social media aandacht vragen en enquetes laten invullen, via infographic of informatief filmpje dingen laten zien/uitleggen.

"40185","18-11-2020","Personal","collector","","745baf","yes","Ja","","1","Ik heb gelezen over een rechtszaak tegen de komst van een windmolenpark inde Veenkoloniën in onze provincie. Dat begrijp ik wel. Ik vraag me namelijk af hoeveel windmolens of zonnepanelen we in Drenthe moeten plaatsen om de gehele provincie van stroom te voorzien. Wat blijft er dan nog over van het prachtige rustige bosrijke Drenthe dat we hebben? Het uitzicht van landelijk wonen. De mooie horizon. Over honderd jaar kijken we dan met heimwee terug naar de schilderijtjes uit lang vervlogen tijden waar je op de horizon geen turbine tegen kwam. 
Begrijp me niet verkeerd ik ben een voorstander van groene energie. Op onze woning willen we ook zonnepanelen gaan installeren. Maar we moeten niet ons landschap er mee gaan vervuilen. En dat gebeurt toch met dat soort parken. Want die staan altijd in het buitengebied. Waarom worden de windmolens niet midden in een stad gezet?
Met alleen windmolens en zonnepanelen gaan we ook nooit volledig in onze energie voorziening voorzien. Ik ben absoluut geen voorstander van het verbranden van biomassa. Daar wordt een hoeveelheid hout in gestookt die we never nooit in dat tempo bij kunnen planten. Ik zou denk ik eerder pleiten voor kernenergie. Met een paar kerncentrales zouden we veel meer stroom kunnen opleveren op een kleiner oppervlak dat dat we ooit met biomassacentrales, wind- en zonneparken op kunnen leveren.","0","0.86","0.14","0","0","","","0","0","0.37391304347826","0.70866141732283","0","0","0.86","0.14","0","0","Zon- en windenergie in Drenthe is niet de oplossing","0","0.68","0.32","0","0","0.27","0.73","0","0","3 grote windmolens","0","1","0","0","0","0.97768015258019","0.031933854634231","0.96507158458401","0","0","0","2","1","5","8","3","4","6","7","0","0","1","0","0.99590211354885","0","0","1","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","","0","0","1","0","0","0","Mensen moeten ingelicht worden over de hoeveelheid stroom die opgeleverd wordt en die ook daadwerkelijk voor de mensen beschikbaar is.

Dan zouden deze parken dus veel minder energie opwekken dan met dit aantal panelen mogelijk zou zijn. 
Zou dat ermee te maken hebben, dat bij het ontwerpen van de parken alleen maar gekeken wordt naar het maximale aantal panelen dat geplaatst kan worden, zodat de geldschieters tevreden zijn. Terwijl de energie opbrengst niet het maximale is wat met deze panelen mogelijk zou zijn.

Daarnaast zou je graag willen dat de energie niet alleen opgewekt wordt, maar ook enige tijd opgeslagen kan worden.

wanneer ik in mijn achtertuin sta, kijk ik tegen meer dan veertig windmolens op Duits grondgebied aan. Red light district met rood lonkende lampjes in de winterse duisternis. Sinds kort zie in vanuit de voortuin zestien windmolens in aanbouw tussen Emmer-Compascuum en Barger-Compascuum. Uiteindelijk zullen er ook vanuit de woonkamer van die vleermuizen- en vogelgehaktmolens zichtbaar worden, die aan de Pottendijk gepland zijn. Het kleinschalige weidse veenlandschap is al door schaalvergroting en ruilverkaveling naar de knoppen geholpen, met die 'gehaktmolens' gaat het compleet naar de bliksem. Vijftien jaar geleden zag ik op zomeravonden vanaf de schemertijd volop vleermuizen vliegen boven de achtertuin, afgelopen zomer was ik al blij wanneer ik er eentje, hooguit twee zag. Patrijzen, wulpen, kieviten, scholeksters? Al in geen jaren meer in of naast de tuin gehad.

We hebben zelf zonnepanelen op het dak. In de zomer kunnen we heel vaak niet terugleveren aan het net, omdat de netspanning dan te hoog is. Hoe gaat het dan als er nog eens enorme zonneparken bij komen?

"40223","18-11-2020","Personal","collector","","745baf","yes","Ja","","1","verschrikkelijk lelijk en zonde van de omgeving die zonneparken en windmolens. Alsof dit aan de energiebehoefte kan voldoen. Bovendien wil je ook niet in de buurt wonen van die windmolens. Er staan een aantal vlakbij mijn werk in Coevorden. Als de zon zoals nu laag schijnt, wordt je gek van de schaduwen en je hoort ook een zoemend geluid wat erg onprettig is. Leuk die zonneparken, in het najaar en in de winter schiet het alleen niet echt op. Zomers heel veel opbrengst, misschien wel meer dan de vraag. Waar moet je ermee heen? En wat in de winter als het ook nog windstil is? Misschien is een gascentrale of kerncentrale zo gek nog niet. 

De grootste zorgen die ik heb is dat men zich blindstaart op windmolens en zonneparken. Stroom is vraag en aanbod. Overschat aan aanbod moet je kwijt, maar waarheen? Een grote vraag en dan? Stroom uit het buitenland tegen een hige prijs? Wat als een windmolen niet meer gebruikt kan worden, recyclen schijnt nogal lastig te zijn. Hetzelfde geld voor panelen. Is dit over 20 a 25 jaar het nieuwe asbest? Of denkt de politiek niet zo ver vooruit, of denken de huidige politici, niet mijn probleem, lost iemand anders later wel op. 

En dan nog de zonnepanelen op mijn eigen dak. over een heel jaar wek ik zoveel op als ik verbruik. Nu wordt dat nog eerlijk tegen elkaar weggestreept. Daar gaat ook verandering in komen. Een beter milieu en de energietransitie mag, maar de burger moet daar wel voor betalen natuurlijk. De gasloze huizen blijken nu ook duurder uut te vallen en in veel situaties toch niet zo succesvol. Wel meer stroomverbruik. dat dan weer wel. Want gas is vies en vervuilend (Daarom gaan een hoop Duitse huishuidens ook over op gas). We moeten van het gas af, omdat Groningen beeft. Nee, de overheid heeft jarenlang gedacht, gratis geld. Men wist dat er ooit een einde aan zou komen. In plaats van zoals in Noorwegen de opbrengsten in een fonds te stoppen zodat de samenleving en burgers er van profiteerden deden ze het in Den Haag anders. Ja, erg van die huizen daar. Maar huizen daar op de kleigrond gebouwd begin 20e eeuw in een arme regio, zullen die zonder aardbevingen ook wel stabd hebben gehouden?  

De groene lobby is sterk en dat wordt mooi door je strot gedouwd. Dat de energie transitie moet gebeuren staat vast, maar blijd staren op windmolens en zonneparken getuigd van weinig visie. Geothermie moet ook onderdeel zijn. Kijk naar Frankrijk en Duitsland. Gasloos gaat hem niet worden. Ga meer boren in de Noordzee, afhankelijk worden van Russisch gas is wel het domste wat je kan doen. Graai als overheid niet zoveel in de gasbaten, maar zorg dat dit terugkomt naar de samenleving","0","0.93","0.07","0","0","0.2","0.8","0","0","0.66666666666667","0.27149621212121","0","0","0.29","0.71","0","0","De waanzin van zon-en windenergie","0","0.3","0.7","0","0","0.26","0.74","0","0","Een combinatie van beiden","0","1","0","0","0","0.43572361990419","0.66443056534766","0.6503389315642","0","0","0","3","1","7","5","6","8","4","2","0","0","0.70182707157466","0.5348921624887","0.51306212044512","0","0","1","0","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","","0","0","0","1","0","0","Wat zijn alternatieven?

Het begon al toen de provincie bepaalde delen van Drenthe aanwees als 'zoekgebied'. Nou, daar ben je mooi klaar mee als je daar toevallig woont. De initiatiefnemers regelden het ff in Den Haag zonder overleg met de omgeving en voordat de omwonenden er iets tegen in konden brengen, was het al te laat. Want ineens vielen de windparken onder de Rijkscoordinatieregeling. Nou, berg je dan maar. Den Haag kent de lokale situatie niet en heeft zich daar ook niet in verdiept. Het ministerie van EZ heeft dan wel een rij verwijderd, maar laat dat nou net de verkeerde rij zijn. Dat is toch eigenlijk nauwelijks te bevatten? Draagvlak voor het alternatief zonneparken is nooit serieus overwogen door het ministerie. Waarom niet? Er stond nu eenmaal vast dat 6000MW op land moest worden gerealiseerd. Nu hebben we dan de RES, he buurman? Wat denk je? Zullen we nu echt mee kunnen praten? Weet je dat ik gewoon niet geloof? Ja, ik denk dat ik mijn zegje kan doen. Dat doe ik nu. Maar of ik daarmee dan ook invloed heb op de besluitvorming? Nou, dat denk ik dus niet. Op papier staat het leuk dat de omgeving erbij betrokken moet worden. En met deze enquete kan dan worden aangetoond dat dit daadwerkelijk is gebeurd. Maar waar het natuurlijk om gaat is dat initiatieven van begin tot eind in samenspraak met de omgeving worden opgezet.

De vortexbladeless zou voor kleinschalige toepassingen (bv voor wijken, straten, dorpen) een oplossing kunnen zijn.
Ze maken geen lawaait, vogels vliegen niet te pletter en kunnen in alle kleuren worden geleverd. Ze kunnen ook dichterbij elkaar worden geplaatst omdat er geen slagschaduw is.
Ook het idee om zwevende zonneparken icm met windenergie is miscchien megalomaan, maar was dat een windmolen uit 1600 ook niet?

In de buurt ontstond veel reuring. Ook mijn vrouw en ik raakten in discussies verstrikt. Mijn vrouw (die voor de transitie is naar meer alternatieve energie zei; ""maar niet in mijn achtertuin!"".
Ik deelde die mening niet. Ik ben van mening dat het logisch is dat de transitie (zonnepanelen) ook offers vraagt van ons als burger en dat ik derhalve niet tegen deze ontwikkeling kan zijn.
Het is echter wel zo dat ik vind dat het hier om bovenregionale besluitvorming moet gaan. Wellicht op overheidsniveau. Ik vind dat vanuit de overheid aanwijsplekken moeten ontstaan.
Zelf lijkt het me logisch dit zoveel mogelijk langs (drukke) wegen te doen en in industrie gebieden.

Voorts denk ik dat het belang voor ons burgers inzichtelijk moet worden gemaakt. Wat is het voordeel bij het ja zeggen tegen een grootschalig project waar ook horizon vervuiling aan kleeft?
Het voordeel zou reductie op de prijs van energie kunnen zijn of hulp bij het van het gas af gaan of subsidie op een  warmtepomp installatie aan huis of in de wijken. 
Wat niet moet is dat er van de regio een forse investering gevraagd word van de burger en dat Google earth daarbij de proviteur is van goedkope stroom op gesubsidieerd overheidsgeld.

Anderzijds is het goed, zo niet nog belangrijker, om het unieke karakter van de provincie Drenthe (relatief dun bevolkt i.v.m. andere provincies, veel groen, veel natuur(parken), karakteristieke dorpen zoals b.v. Westerbork en Dwingeloo, etc., etc.) zo goed mogelijk te behouden.
Grote windmolens verstoren in een heel grote omgeving het uniek mooie beeld van Drenthe.
Ook grote zonneparken zijn verstorend, met name als dit ten koste gaat van natuur en/of karakteristieke streken, dorpen, etc. M.a.w., het is horizonvervuilend.
Bovendien is economische en milieutechnische winst in feite beperkt. Het produceren van windmolens kost veel energie en materiaal, en ook dat is milieuvervuilend. De productie van de windmolens is relatief duur en gezien de levensduur van de windmolens uiteindelijk relatief oneconomisch.
Hetzelfde geldt voor de productie en plaatsing van zonneparken: ook (te) kostbaar, milieuvervuilend en energieslurpend, ook resulterend in een (te) grote terugverdientijd.
Daarom is het goed als naar nog andere energiebronnen wordt gekeken, die uiteindelijk niet of minder verstorend werken. Wellicht is het gebruik van waterstof op termijn een goed alternatief.
Andere betere, en in het realiseren daarvan uiteindelijk minder mileuvervuilende opties moeten worden overwogen.

Grootste fout bij het ontwikkelen van deze wind- en zonneparken is dat de omwonenden veel te laat geïnformeerd werden en eigenlijk geen invloed hebben gehad op de besluitvorming. Nu ontstonden er (agressieve) protesten. Wanneer er meer participatiemogelijkheden aangeboden zouden zijn in de vorm van ""winddelen"" of iets dergelijks, was het draagvlak waarschijnlijk groter geweest. Wat van jezelf is, heb je in de regel minder last van.

Als mensen gehoord worden, hun bezwaren, angsten, vooroordelen en weet ik wat nog meer, kwijt kunnen en ze serieus genomen worden, dan is er veel meer mogelijk.
Pas als je weet hoe alle betrokkenen er in staan, kan je levensvatbare plannen uit gaan werken.

Laat de mogelijkheid open van participatie voor iedereen, niet alleen de energiemaatschappijen, andere grote bedrijven en aandeelhouders.
En biedt deze mogelijkheid vanaf het begin aan.

Ik verbaas me erover dat juist in de veenkoloniën zoveel weerstand is. Dan is ondanks de nabije gastoestanden de noodzaak niet goed gecommuniceerd. Daar zou in eerste instantie werk van gemaakt moeten worden. Mensen zullen er eerst van overtuigd moeten worden, dat ze niet het afvoerputje van Nederland zijn. En dat bereik je alleen door ze de mond te gunnen en serieus te nemen.

"40300","19-11-2020","Personal","collector","","745baf","yes","Ja","","1","Wrang om te vernemen dat dit initiatief op gang komt na plaatsing van diverse windmolens in de regio zuidoost Drenthe.  Sinds kort zie ik aan de horizon draaiende reuzen verschijnen en s'avonds verdelende lichten knipperen in omgeving de Monden. Dit is voor mij op een afstand van ca. 25 km.  Het geeft voor mij duidelijk weer dat de impact van windmolens enorm is. Wanneer ik dan bedenk dat er op 1.5 km in het zelfde uitzicht ook molens worden geplaats kan ik mij daar behoorlijk kwaad over maken. Het onvervuilde  wijdse uitzicht was voor mij altijd een van de grootse woonkwaliteiten. Dit verdwijnt nu. Ik heb ooit een wethouder van de gemeente Emmen horen zeggen dat de dorpen nooitt ingesloten mogen raken door windmolens. Dit gebeurd nu dus wel. Windmolens in de Monden, Pottendijk en langs de grens aan Duitse zijde zorgen er voor dat veel dorpen langs de grens omsloten worden door molens. Zuid Oost Drenthe en met name de buitendorpen in dit gebied staan al niet best op de kaart. Laag geschoolde mensen, veel werkloosheid en minder toekomst perspectief. Voor mij voelt het plaatsen van molens in dit gebied als een extra duw de verkeerde kant op. Er zijn meer plekken in Drenthe/land/zee waar ruimte genoeg is voor molens. Ik ben voor duurzame manier van energie opwekken, maar dan wel op een eerlijke manier die gedragen wordt door de bevolking. Nu zijn er een paar mensen die er echt beter van worden (boeren en projectontwikkelaars) terwijl er enorm veel mensen moeten uitkijken op lelijke molens. Er worden vergoedingen uitgekeerd aan mensen die dicht bij molens wonen. Maar woon je net buiten de straal die bepaald of je planschade ontvangt krijg je niets. Terwijl je de molens net zo goed ziet staan als je buurman. Gevoelsmatig wordt het door je strot geduwd.

Ik heb het gevoel dat veel mensen zich al hebben overgegeven. We zijn murw geslagen. Excuus voor de negativiteit. 

Luister vooral naar de mensen die een onderbouwt bezwaar hebben tegen windmolens. Mensen van wie hun horizon vervuilt raakt met daling van de woningwaarde tot gevolg. Alleen praten is niet genoeg. Geef transparantie in de overleggen en creeer geen valse hoop. Zorg er voor dat de last van verzuurzaming eerlijker verspreidt wordt over alle gebruikers.

"40312","19-11-2020","Personal","collector","","745baf","yes","Ja","","1","Ik reed laatst langs een windmolenpark bij coevorden. Het was een mooie dag en de zon scheen. Het merkte mij op dat ik na een tijdje me begon te ergeren aan de schaduw slagen van de wieken , ik dacht bij me zelf, je zou hier maar wonen daar zou je toch gek van worden.  Ik denk dat als je er echt zelf woont dat je van nog veel meer dingen last hebt of krijgt.

Ik heb ook het idee dat onze Duitse vrienden ook lekker door bouwen met windmolens langs de grens. (dit ter zijde). 

Ik weet dat we aan de energie transitie moeten bijdragen en ben een voorstander van groene stroom maar zo'n groot monster hoef ik niet dicht bij mijn huis. De kleinere varianten zie ik dan veel liever, deze vallen niet zo erg op in de buurt en kun je er ook meer van kwijt. 

Voor de grotere molens, als ze toch geplaatst moeten worden zou ik graag adviseren om ze ten allen tijde aan de noord/oost kant van een dorp of een groepje boerderijen te plaatsen. Op deze manier heb je als omwonenden er het minste last van. 
Je zit dan nooit in de schaduw van de molens. 
Ook komt de wind meestal uit het westen en op deze manier waait het eventuele geluid van de molens ook van het dorp af in plaats van er doorheen. 

Wat de grote zonneweides betreft vind ik het jammer dat ze op zulke mooie landbouwgrond komen te staan.

Persoonlijk ben ik hier wel een voorstander van en denk ik dat dit een goede bijdrage levert aan het opschalen van duurzame energie in Drenthe maar vooral ook in Nederland in zijn algemeen. Het is wel een beetje zonde dat de schaarse grond die we in Nederland hebben hiervoor gebruikt wordt maar het is wel een stuk minder horizon vervuilend dan windmolens. Meer zonnepanelen op daken zou beter zijn maar dit is maar een gedeelte van de oplossing en bovendien de eigen keuze van mensen. Vaak is dit wel gewoon rendabel voor mensen maar weten ze er het fijne niet van. Ik denk dat het goed zou zijn als zonnepanelen meer op overheidsgebouwen als gemeentehuizen worden geplaatst zodat het goede voorbeeld wordt gegeven en mensen ook meer vertrouwen hebben in de oprechtheid van de overheid m.b.t. het aan de kaak stellen van klimaatproblemen.

Ik wil erg graag meewerken aan de energietransitie maar kwam niet in aanmerking voor subsidie voor zonnepanelen omdat ik nog geen jaarcijfers kon overleggen. Dat vind ik echt een gemiste kans! Voor mijn bedrijf komen windmolens. Zelf vind ik dat prima, zolang er maar een windrichting blijft waarin ik ongestoord naar de hemel kan kijken. Reden dat ik geen bezwaar heb is dat ik graag energie wil kunnen blijven gebruiken en mij terdege besef dat alleen groene energie kan zorgen voor een veilige en schone toekomst. Ik zou graag zien dat er zoveel mogelijk (grote) daken bedekt gaan worden met zonnepanelen ipv zonneparken aangezien grond in Nederland als een schaars goed is.","0","0.72","0.28","0","0","0.67","0.33","0","0","0.58695652173913","0.24803149606299","0","0","0","1","0","0","Geef zon- en windenergie de ruimte voor een veilige en schone toekomst.","0","1","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","3 grote windmolens","0","0","1","0","0","0.99677941328626","0.0045619792334616","0.99149347613356","0","0","8","3","0","4","1","5","6","7","2","0","0","0.59317133886666","0.6039498845594","0.53229716376429","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","0","0","0","me nu schamen dit ik niet meer doe","","0","1","0","0","0","Het is noodzakelijk, hoe en waar gaan we het realiseren?

Bij Zuidbroek zag ik tot mijn schrik in de buurt van de afslag naar de Eemshaven een windpark.
Dat was nieuw en ik schrok ervan. Zo dichtbij en zo aanwezig. 
En weer kwam bij me op wat dit met de luchtstromen in de lagere luchtlagen doet en of er geen vogels tegenaan en zich dood zouden vliegen en of het geluid geen permanente verandering in de beleving van de omgeving zou geven.
Dit zijn gedachten die ik wel vaker heb als ik grote windparken zie.
Enkele dagen later las ik in Trouw over vogelsterfte door windmolens. Bezint eer ge begint.
Bij zonneparken op grote schaal vraag ik me altijd af hoe die onderhouden worden als er een paar seizoenen overheen zijn gegaan en wat  gaat gebeuren met het land dat eronder ligt.
En wat als de één of andere malloot in een boze bui die dingen kapot gaat maken.

ik vind dit totaal niet passen in de mooie natuur van drenthe en erger mij ook iedere keer aan deze zonneparken als ik er langs kom. 
er zijn genoeg bedrijven die graag zonnepanelen op hun daken leggen en ook om terug te leveren aan het net, zorg liever dat dit mogelijk is in plaats van natuur of landbouwgrond hiervoor op te offeren. 
buiten deze reden om ben ik zowiezo al tegen zonnepanelen omdat ik het zie als een verdienmodel, waarbij het verhaal duurzame energie wordt opgehouden om mensen te overtuigen (waar best een kern van waarheid in zal zitten). maar zonnepanelen zijn na een aantal jaar aan vervanging toe en ik denk dat je daar het nieuwe asbest hebt met de schadelijke stoffen etcetera hebt over een aantal jaren. 
zonnepanelen zie ik liever helemaal niet, maar als het dan toch moet dan zie ik ze liever op daken van bedrijven die hier voordeel uit kunnen halen en wat niet ten koste gaat van natuur en landbouwgrond! 
windmolens op plekken zie ik dan nog wel weer mogelijkheden omdat dit in mijn ogen ook echt duurzamer is dan zonnepanelen. mits natuurlijk niet heel drenthe vol wordt gezet met windmolens, echter op plekken waar weinig tot geen mensen en dieren er last van ondervinden.

De zonneparken die momenteel in een rap tempo worden gerealiseerd vind ik foei lelijk en geen gezicht voor het oog. Ondanks dat deze in weilanden langs provincie wegen of snelwegen worden gesitueerd ben ik van mening dat dit het mooie landschap niet ten goede komt. Ik zie dan liever koeien in de wei lopen.

Met windmolens heb ik minder moeite. Maar heb ik wel de indruk dat er niet naar bezwaren van bewoners of natuurorganisaties wordt geluisterd.

"40838","30-11-2020","Personal","collector","","745baf","yes","Ja","","1","Het tegengaan van vervuilende energie opwekking vindt ik belangrijk. Welke vorm dit krijgt is minder belangrijk. Wat er wel toe doet is de beschikbaarheid. Beschikbaarheid vertaald zich in twee kanten. Als er geen/onvoldoende wind en/of zon is hebben we wel energie nodig. Er moet dus altijd een backup systeem zijn. Natuurlijk moet dit ook een niet vervuilend systeem zijn. Aan de andere kant is het net zo belangrijk dat als er erg veel wind en/of zon is de energie systemen niet op hol slaan. Dit balanceren is het moeilijkste punt van deze vormen van energie winning.  Te veel is bijna niet weg te regelen, bij windmolens is dat nog wel mogelijk, bij vast opgestelde zonnepanelen niet. 
Ik vindt wel dat windmolens naar mijn idee het landschap te veel aantasten. Ik weet ook wel dat een windmolen efficienter werkt maar dat mag niet ten koste gaan van de omgeving. Zonneparken zijn beter te verstoppen b.v. achter beuken haagjes (s'winters ook in blad, zie rond  kerkhoven) of liguster of coniferen.  Als die zonneparken aangelegd worden op gronden die niet voor landbouw geschikt zijn of daar niet meer voor nodig zijn vindt ik dat geen probleem. We kunnen niet te veel van deze energie opwekken omdat er altijd een variabele rest capaciteit moet zijn. Om deze nog enigzins rendabel te maken moet er een soort minimale afname garantie komen. 
Daardoor zal een energie centrale zoals nu ook energie moeten opwekken. Natuurlijk moet dit schoon zijn. Ik denk persoonlijk dat kernenergie hier prima voor bruikbaar is. 
Ja zeker, ook hier komt afval bij vrij.  Zij het in kleine en  beheerbare volumes. Bij de huidige energie centrales komt het NU vrij en kunnen we het NIET beheersen. Dat is het grote verschil. We hebben nu een CO2 en NOx en etc probleem.  Het zijn keuzes die we moeten maken.","0","0.81","0.19","0","0","0.7","0.3","0","0","0.60869565217391","0.27952755905512","0","0","0.08","0.92","0","0","Energie Beheer(s)en !","0","0.61","0.39","0","0","0.37","0.63","0","0","60 voetbalvelden zonnepanelen","0","0.51","0.49","0","0","0.77428090904957","0.2654781875298","0.78464053555193","0","0","0","1","4","6","3","8","5","7","2","0","0","0.45871149221546","0.81365172913006","0.54275092261169","0","0","1","1","0","0","1","1","1","0","0","0","Lees mij in, af en toe volgen van lezingen ","0","0","0.04","0.96","0","0","Eerst zorgen dat mensen weten waar ze over praten, daarna zorgen dat diegenen die de discussie voorbereiden 100% open zijn en niet een al voor ingenomen mening hebben.

Het klinkt mooi hoor, groene energie. Maar ik heb het idee dat er zo veel mee gesjoemeld word. Door ""groene"" energie bedrijven die gewoon certificaten uit het buitenland kopen en wethouders die nieuwe data centers aanleggen en daarmee hele groene projecten opkopen. 
Misschien moeten we maar eens wat minder energie gaan gebruiken, ipv meewerken met hebberige bedrijven die vooral zoveel mogelijk subsidie willen losweken.

Geen idee of iemand dit leest, maar voelt toch fijn om ergens mijn verhaal kwijt te kunnen. Dank je wel.

Je ziet nu door Nederland heen steeds meer velden met zonnepanelen opduiken. Maar eigenlijk is dat jammer van de ruimte. We zijn al en klein land en als we dan ook nog bruikbaar land (landbouw, huizen, recreatie) gaan gebruiken voor zonnepanelen schieten we onszelf in de voet. 
Gelukkig zie je ook steeds meer initiatieven op geluisdwallen langs snelwegen. Enorm slim gebruik van ruimte die nergens anders voor gebruikt kan worden.
Dit geeft mij hoop dat er steeds meer initiatieven komen om 'onbruikbare ruimtes' zoals daken en wallen te gaan gebruiken om zonne-energie op te wekken.

"41044","09-12-2020","Personal","collector","","745baf","yes","Ja","","1","Windmolens plaatsen naast de rdiotelescoop Lofar (van Astron, bij Exloo) is zo ongeveer het meest contraproductieve dat men zou moeten kunnen bedenken. Er stonden daar ooit 20 bomen die gekapt moesten worden omdat ze rechtop stonden en dus radiogolven reflecteren. Mensen die rechtop lopen langs de antennes verstoren de ontvangst. Er mag daar niets rechtop staan, op straffe van het waardeloos maken van een wetenschapsinstrument dat 100 miljoen euro heeft gekost. En dan zet je er 200 meter hoge draaiende, dus bewegende, windmolens naast. Als iemand in Veendam een lasapparaat aanzet knalt dat nu via de rotorbladen op het instrument.
Lofar moet 13 miljard jaar oude radiogolven opvangen, de energieinhoud van die golven is uiterst miniem. Een dergelijk signaal wordt volledig weggedrukt door een reflectie van een lasapparaat.
Verder is het onzin om de molens op land ergens anders te plaatsen dan aan de kust. Daar waait het twee keer zo vaak.
Windturbines wekken wel stroom op maar daar heb je niets aan als de opwekking niet EN grootschalig is (of op een heel afgelegen plaats waar geen kabel heen kan, maar die hebben we niet in Nederland) EN betrouwbaar in de vorm van on-demand of continue. Doe je er opslag bij dan worden de al beroerde kostenstructuur nog meerdere malen beroerder. Tenzij je die opslag al nodig hebt voor bijvoorbeeld autoaccu's.
Als je op dit moment 5 miljoen investeert in een windturbine dan doe je een bijdrage aan het gebruik van windenergie in Nederland. Als je diezelfde 5 miljoen investeert in de aanschaf van een aantal Tesla auto's en die 's nachts (na 23:00) oplaad dan doe je een investering die voor het gebruik van windenergie veel meer waarde heeft. Op dit moment hebben we meer behoefte aan een schakelbare elektriciteitsvraag dan aan iets anders.
Het grote probleem is dat om een energienet aan te leggen je goed moet kunnen rekenen en weten wat je moet uitrekenen. De publieke en politieke discussie gaat hier volledig aan voorbij en is grotendeels gebaseerd op simplificaties, irreele angsten en onzinnige dogma's.

Dan zonnepanelen als park uitgevoerd. Ook daar zitten we niet op te wachten. Gras of elk ander gewas zet zonlicht om in een bruikbare vorm van energie. Als je zonnepanelen in weilanden zet dan moet je het rendement van het landbouwgewas aftrekken van de opbrengst van de panelen. Ook wateroppervlakten hebben zonlicht nodig. Anders sterft elk leven in zo'n plas.

Vlak voor Hoogeveen werd een weiland helemaal vol gezet met zonnepanelen.  Er stonden wel  bouwhekken met schermen om heen, maar je zag duidelijk de zonnepanalen.   Nu vind ik dat niet erg maar ik weet dat er veel mensen zijn die zich daar aan storen.  Vandaag kwam ik daar weer langs en tot mijn verbazing zag ik niets meer van de zonnepanelen want om het hele gebied ligt nu een aarden wal die de zonnepanelen aan het oog onttrekt. Prima oplossing om van het gezeur van critici af te zijn. De wal beplanten met struiken zou ook nog een idee zijn.  Als er gras op komt moet dat weer gemaaid worden. Dan beter gekozen voor een bloemrijk mengsel. Hebben de insecten er ook nog wat aan en het hoeft maar 
1x keer jaad gemaaid!

"41065","09-12-2020","Personal","collector","","745baf","yes","Ja","","1","Ben van mening dat er veel te veel lantaarnpalen aan staan zoals bij mij aan de zende ( woon op 33 en 1 recht voor mijn raam wat ook wel uit kan in de nacht of helemaal) want om de paar meter staan ze aan en vindt ik onnodig energie verbruik.
Ben grote voorstander van energie parken en windmolens want denk voortdurend aan het klimaat en let zelf ook overal op en hoe meer er wordt opgewekt én er verstandig mee om wordt gegaan hoe beter voor deze aarde. 
Heb het zonnepanelen park gezien nabij de N48 in Zuidwolde en helemaal top want heeft geen mens of dier last van en komt juist ten goede voor mens, dier en natuur dus mogen van mij nog wel meer parken bij. 
Ik zou ook willen dat mensen nadenken voordat ze een buitenlamp aanzetten en die vervolgens volle nachten aan laten en zelf gezien dat bewoners die naast elkaar wonen de lampen nachten en af en toe zelfs overdag gewoon door laten branden en is pure energie verspilling want een tijdschakelaar ertussen of lamp met sensor is veel beter voor alles, dus misschien advies erover geven zodat men bewust wordt met hun handelingen.
Als iedereen zo af en toe stil staat bij wat te doen voordat we iets doen dan zijn er minder parken en molens nodig ( omdat velen tegen zijn, al snap ik niet waarom ) en zou ook graag zien dat mensen bewuster omgaan met het drinkwater zoals regenpijpen doorzagen en regenton eronder zodat men niet meer drinkwater aan planten etc gaan geven want zie ik ook overal en erg storend vindt ik dat maar is weer een geheel ander onderwerp, maar dus kortom: bewust worden met wat je doet en beter voor het klimaat.

Zou dit heel erg graag wereldwijd zien want hoe de mens nu omgaat met energie en in hun doen en laten is een vernietiging van klimaat en dus de aarde.

2)

De oorzaak is dat we alle energie in verschillende eenheden verkopen, aardgas in m3, benzine in liters, butaan in kg, stadsverwarming in Gj, elekricireit in kWh.
Als we alle energie in kWh zouden aangeven kunnen we ook een gevoel krijgen voor energie. Vergelijken van prijs, CO2 uistoot, fijnstof enz. is dan veel eenvoudiger.
Waarom staat er op een pak yoghurt hoeveel energie er inzit maar hebben we hiervan geen idee als we een liter benzine kopen?
In 1 liter benzine zit 9,6 kWh aan energie, 6 liter voor 100 km is dan bijna 60 kWh. Een elektrische auto moet je met 20 kWh opladen om 100 km te rijden, zo eenvoudig kan vergelijken worden.
In m3 aardgas zit 9,8 kWh, als ik nu 1200m3 per jaar verbruikt is dat bijna 12000 kWh, een warmtepomp heeft een rendament van 300% dus ga ik bij het overstappen 4000 kWh meer stroom verbruiken.
Zorg dat bij verkoop van energie de energie waarde aan de klant wordt gegeven dan krijgen ze een gevoel bij energie en kunnen ze het ook zelf vergelijken.
De energielabels lopen uit hun range met alle +++ er achter, laten we het rendement van machines weer in % aangeven dan kunnen we zelf berekenen hoe we het beste kunnen besparen.","0","0.89","0.11","0","0","0.76","0.24","0","0","0.65787760416667","0.32670861446496","0","0","0.51","0.49","0","0","Zo krijg je inzicht in je energie verbruik.","0","0.74","0.26","0","0","0.51","0.49","0","0","60 voetbalvelden zonnepanelen","0","0.08","0.92","0","0","0.99023729610531","0.010057464787833","0.98718212981868","0","0","0","2","3","8","4","7","6","5","1","0","0","0.56103649891821","0.5809891663807","0.58364347620732","0","0","0","0","0","0","0","1","1","0","0","0","zou graag mijn verhaal presenteren maar weet niet hoe","","0","0.25","0.75","0","0","Ik zou concreet plannen uit werken en de burgers laten stemmen per dorp of gemeenschap met een straal van 7 km rond het project.","0","64","0","0","Man","0","Koopwoning","0","Beroepsonderwijs (MBO / HBO)","0","Boven modaal","0","Tynaarlo","0","9761hk","0","Ja","0","1","0","0","0","Ja","w.vanderdoes@planet.nl","0","Nee","0","","0","","1","Ja","0","56 – 65 jaar","Platteland"

In de donkere nacht zagen wij in verte en lichtende propeller van een lange rij windmolens. 
Een donker helder met nachtelijke stilte, donker blauw lucht met sterren en op horizon een lange rij van knipperende licht van propellers. Dat is altijd bij ons gebleven.

o ClimateLaunchpad: dit is 's werelds grootste wedstrijd voor groene zakenideeën voor schoon
technologieën. De wedstrijd trekt meer dan 1.000 ideeën uit meer dan 25 landen en aanbiedingen
coaching en financiële ondersteuning van de meest succesvolle ideeën.

Echter is het wel zo dat er iets moet worden ogeofferd. zoals het aanzien van de omgeving of de vrijheid tot plaatsen van zonnepanelen daar waar het echt een hoog rendement heeft. Het is moeilijk te bepalen of al die nieuwe iedeeen bijdragen tot een eerlijke verdeling naar de toekomst toe. Ook aan deze nieuwe technologische ontwikkeling zullen er mensen en  ondernemeimgen zijn die hier grof aan kunnen verdienen. Zo is het gevoel dat we het met z'n allen moeten doen weer wat minder. Begrijp wel dat investeringen er weer uitgehaald moeten worden. Een regeling zoals bij het ontwikkelen van medicijnen is moeilijk in te voeren. Dan hebben we op lange termijn te maken met overcapaciteit. De zomers worden steeds langer en de gemiddelde tijd aan zonuren groter. Het zou zinvol zijn om op een efficiente manier te gaan investeren en gebouwen en woningen te voorzien van zonnepanelen en het verder ontwikkelen van opslag in waterstof reservoirs. Het netwerk in Nederland is er volgens mij niet op toegerust de levering van stroom door derden te verwerken. Wat de toekomst verder aan nieuwe ontwikkelingen zal brengen is moeilijk te overzien. Dat wij naar de toekomst toe verder moeten innoveren en moeten nadenken over het vernielen van onze aarde is iets wat zeker is.

omdat ik hier de ruimte heb, stel ik in een uitgebreidere vorm de vraag van de vorige pagina:
waarom wordt er in dit onderzoek totaal niet gesproken over de mogelijheid om de duizenden m2 oppervlak van daken bij boerenbedrijven te beleggen met zonnepanelen?
waarom wordt er niet voorgesteld om particulieren in groepsverband de gelegenheid te geven kleine windmolens te plaatsen?
moeten er net als in de provincie groningen of in de wieringermeerpolder de provincie drenthe verpest worden met grootschalige energieopwekkingsmogelijkheden?
dan hebben we energie maar een onleefbare omgeving; weg met de rust ( draaiende wieken ), de ruimte ( horizonvervuiling en glinsterende zonnepaneelvelden, snachts de felle lampen van de windmolens) .
de schoonheid van het nu nog redelijk onaangetaste landschap , niet verstoord door industriele ingrepen van de mens, zal op de psyche van de inwoners, en niet te vergeten de bezoekers als weldadig overkomen !
de plannen voor de RES moeten aan de inwoners voorgelegd worden en daarbij zullen lessen geleerd moeten zijn van de manier, waarop de in bv. groningen windmolenparken doorgedrukt zijn.
ik wens de provincie veel wijsheid toe.","0","Ja","0","66 – 75 jaar","Platteland"

De 2 mooiste provincies van Nederland. En met het huidige beleid zal het opwekken van deze vorm van energie niet genoeg zijn in de toekomst en wil een bepaalde linkse partij ook nog een kerncentrale in Groningen gaan bouwen.
En wat heel lullig is dat de overheid de windmolen parken aan buitenlandse bedrijven zoals Vattenfall verkoopt, dat kan toch niet de bedoeling zijn van deze transitie?
Waarom kijken we nou niet eens anders naar het probleem wat we hebben? We moeten hiervoor alleen anders gaan denken. 
We hebben overal een ""maximum aantal"" voor, we willen ... aantal varkens in Nederland, we willen ... aantal kippen in Nederland, er mogen zoveel koeien in Nederland, maar
hoeveel mensen willen we eigenlijk in Nederland? 18 miljoen, pfff, en dat worden er nog heel veel meer als het zo doorgaat. Laten we daar nu eens een maximum aantal van maken.
Dan is er weer een balans tussen mens, dier en natuur en kunnen we veel beter inspelen op algeheel verbruik van energie, water, grondstoffen, enz.

Een professor zei eens: Er is niet te weinig water in Drenthe, er zijn gewoon teveel mensen...

Toch nog een kleine notitie, ik heb zoals zoveel anderen een plat dat waarop nu maar 8 zonnepanelen liggen, maar er kunnen er wel 20 liggen. Waarom niet de daken bekleden met zonnepanelen?

trouwens ik loop al jaren met een idee in mij hoofd van duurzaam energie op te wekken terwijl niemand er laat van hoeft te hebben. het is uiteraad een idee maar of het wil is het 2e dan kom ik op het volgende punt uit als ik dat hier vermeld en een ander er mee van door gaat dan wordt ik er zelf niet beter op! 

over de zonnen panelen, ik weet niet wat jullie de van vinden maar ik had toch liever koeien er staan inplaats van nutteloze constructies! aangezien het hier mee ook alleen om geld en macht gaat anders zullen ze het ook niet omdraaien als je energie levert krijg je geld terug dat gaat er straks van af door die rot Parken dus doe je als brave Nederlander mee aan de eisen van de regering en wordt jou eerst een worst voor gehangen die uit eindelijk van korte duur is!

"41611","21-12-2020","Personal","collector","","745baf","yes","Ja","","1","Als inwoner van Gasselternijveenschemond kijk ik straks tegen een groot windpark aan.  Ondanks alle protesten van ons als bewoners van het gebied is de bouw gewoon doorgegaan. De initiatiefnemers hebben daarvoor een Rijksinpassingsplan aangevraagd, zodat de gemeente Aa en Hunze er niets meer over te zeggen had en het plan gewoon door kon gaan. 
Er is totaal niet geluisterd naar ons als inwoners . Voor de initiatiefnemers is het alleen een kwestie van geld, ze hadden de eurotekens in de ogen staan en vergaten daarbij dat dit plan heel veel negatieve invloed heeft op de woonsituatie van ons. Het wil al wel wat zeggen dat diverse initiatiefnemers inmiddels uit het gebied zijn verhuisd. Zij hoeven niet tegen die kolossale windmolens aan te kijken. Wij worden er  wel elke dag mee geconfronteerd. 's Avonds zien we nu ook al de rode lichten op de molens bij de N33 en dat wordt straks nog erger als dit park met 45 molens klaar is. Het wordt dan één geknipper van rode lichten. Om gek van te worden!
En dan heb ik het nog niet eens over alle zonneparken die overal verschijnen. Als burger ben ik bang dat onze hele leefomgeving wordt verpest. Ik hoop dan ook niet dat ik zo'n zonnepark voor de deur krijg. Ik zou overwegen om te gaan verhuizen.
Ik voel dat ik als burger nergens meer iets over te zeggen heb. Alles is al beslist voordat het in de openbaarheid komt. Dat geeft een gevoel van onmacht. Ik denk dat dit gevoel de komende jaren nog wel erger wordt, met alle regels en plannen die door de overheid worden bedacht.

Van grote molens is de overlast voor de omwonenden en de opbrengst vloeit weg naar elders. Kleinschalige opwekking is beter te accepteren. De lasten liggen dan bij mensen die er ook de lusten van hebben.
Tegenover ons huis staat een kleine windmolen en daar ben ik blij mee. Hij is niet lelijk en ik heb profijt van de opbrengst.

Zonnepanelen kunnen het beste op de daken. Pas als die vol liggen moeten we denken aan zonnevelden. Bij de zonnevelden zou het beter zijn de panelen zo hoog te leggen dat je er onderdoor kan lopen.
